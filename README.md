# DFS
Generates an undirected graph given nodes, edge information. Performs depth first search on this graph making sure to traverse every edge and outputs a circuit.

To execute:
1. Type "make" in a command line to compile and it should generate an executable file called "assignment7".
2. Type "./assignment7" to execute the file.
3. You need to have the “graph.txt” (input) file in the same folder as Makefile/Assignment7.cpp files
4. To store its output into a file named output.txt, Type "./assignment7 > output.txt"
